# 27. May

This is the first in a series of the most intimate writings about my life. These writings shall be my life's footprint. I'll publish these. At some point, hopefully sooner than later. I will. And when I do. Well - If I've been doing retarded things with my life, everybody will see. What a motivation!

It kind of feels like I spent the whole semester trying to love Martina. She came into my life, at a moment where I was barely holding my own one together. And I thought to myself. Deep down, I'll regret not having the courage to love her fully. So I let deadlines slide, skipped lectures, and put everything into it. Yet now I'm here. Stranded in a metaphorical pit, with immense pressure from all sides.

How much I wish the story from her was: I trust you; I love you; We'll figure it out. Yet I guess life isn't a fairy tale. I suppose you rarely get what you wish for. I suppose the sad lesson here is, to, just stop. Love isn't. It's a biological algorithm. Now the question that's in front of me, is what do I want to do with my life? There's multiple possible stories in front of me.

One is, I decide to stay safe, move back to my hometown in Ostrava.  Or in Prague. Or whatever. Say, look all I care about my friends and being comfortable. Listen to music, watch movies. Write software during the week and go to the pub on the weekends. Make friends along the way. Be fun to be around. There's no pain. Then I'm 30,50, 80. Then dead. My life's statement - safely arrived to the destination, without once doing anything remarkable.

The other alternative is, I wake myself up, face my fears, push myself to the limit, finish TUM and CUNI. Become somebody formidable. Have proper beef with all of the wrongness of this world. Hate the imperfect healthcare, mental illnesses, ads in the city, uninspiring education, not enough community, and all the other wrong in this world. And do it fucking passionately. Maybe this fight will lead to me being poor and alone, where no one will love me. But - I will love myself.

Try and fail. But don't fail to try. :)
